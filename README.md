# 🏀 Basketball Brawl Fantasy Dashboard

This is a web app dashboard built to display unique stats and visualizations for my fantasy basketball league, *Basketball Brawl*. It's a passion project combining my love of fantasy sports with data analysis and dashboard development.

The goal of this project was to:
- Improve my skills in building interactive dashboards
- Visualize fantasy basketball data in ways ESPN doesn't
- Create a fun and informative tool for my league mates
- Work with data I genuinely enjoy exploring

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to challenge myself to create something useful and fun that reflects my interests. Fantasy basketball is a hobby of mine, and building a custom dashboard helped me explore data that ESPN doesn't show — and present it in a much cooler way.
